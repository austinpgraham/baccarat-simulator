# Baccarat Simulator

A simple program that simulates a game of Baccarat given a number of betting strategies. The game rules described here are somewhat
simplified, since at the end of the day I just care about trends in winning; the distribution of wins to loses should be relatively the same

## Usage

Setup python for graphing

```
cd graphing && python3 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Compile and run the simulation:

```
make run
```

# What this was for

This small project is largely just for me to practice my C. It's not great code, I was just trying
to practice the memory management stuff since it's not in my day-to-day. If anyone just so happens to
stumble across this and has some pointers, please feel free!
